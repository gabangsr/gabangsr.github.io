                <h2>Swimming</h2>
                <p>One of my favourite recreational activities to perform, when the time comes and aligns for me. I enjoy swimming a lot as it grew up with me throughout the years</p>

                <h2>Table Tennis</h2>
                <p>Together with swimming, I grew up playing this sport more compared to basketball, despite everyone wanting for me to play basketball. A More intense and fast paced sport for me.</p>

                <h2>Gaming</h2>
                <p>Exploring new things and experiences through virtual means is what gaming means to me. Some people see it as a bad thing, or a way to get lazy. For me, it is a way to explore modern technology through simulated means.</p>

                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p>Whenever exploring the outside world, I occationaly take my phone out to take a picture for a view that is worth taking the memory.</p>

                <h2>Hiking</h2>
                <p>With photography, I just enjoy the outside naturally. The cold air, the sunrise, the exercise and the great view.</p>

                <h2>Basketball</h2>
                <p>As funnily enough as it may seem, I don't play as much basketball as people would assume. It is a sport that I do not take part in most of the time. I would prefer any other sport other than this.</p>
